This study developed a hybrid forecasting framework for flu-related claims across a corporate clinic. Using 2025 year-to-date data, which showed an increase in infectious respiratory diseases (IRDs)—particularly viral infections and influenza—the study aimed to improve vaccine allocation for IRD-related diseases across clinics by providing a three-week forecast and identifying branches with high IRD patient volumes. This approach ensured optimal and cost-effective vaccine distribution across different branches. Each cluster was modeled using two methods: (1) Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA/SARIMA) and (2) an ensemble tree-based model (XGBoost). Model performance was primarily evaluated using MAPE and sMAPE, with RMSE, MSE, and R² as supporting metrics.

For this file, only the XGBoost model is presented, as this was the model I worked with in the project. Most exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations were omitted due to data privacy constraints.
